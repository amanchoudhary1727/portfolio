## Projects

### PyPiHot
PyPiHot is a full-stack package intelligence platform built to give Python developers a complete, unified view of any PyPI package. It aggregates real-time download statistics, detailed PyPI metadata, and GitHub insights such as stars, forks, issues, and topics into a single, clean interface. The platform supports rich package descriptions with enhanced markdown rendering, correctly handling complex READMEs that include badges, images, tables, and embedded HTML. Built with React, TypeScript, ShadCN UI, and FastAPI, and deployed on Vercel, PyPiHot solves the problem of fragmented package information by bringing adoption, quality, and community signals together in one place for faster, more informed decision-making.

### Crypto Assistant
This project is an AI-powered Crypto Assistant and Market Dashboard built during a mini hackathon as part of the Samsung Innovation Campus program. It combines real-time cryptocurrency market data with an intelligent chatbot powered by Google Gemini, allowing users to explore the crypto space both visually and conversationally. The dashboard displays the top 100 cryptocurrencies with live prices and sorting options, while the chatbot answers market-related questions using dynamic outputs such as price charts, comparison tables, and news cards. Built with React 19, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, CoinGecko API, and Gemini API, the project focuses on clean UI, responsive design, and seamless cross-API data orchestration.

### SafeMath
SafeMath is a production-ready Python library that makes mathematical operations reliable and crash-free across Python, NumPy, and Pandas. It safely handles common edge cases like division by zero, invalid logs, negative square roots, overflows, and missing values by returning sensible fallback results instead of raising errors. Designed as a drop-in replacement for standard math operations, SafeMath works seamlessly with scalars, arrays, Series, and DataFrames. With features like configurable fallbacks, method chaining, safe expression evaluation, and optional logging, it helps developers build robust data pipelines, APIs, and machine learning workflows that never fail due to unsafe math operations.

### Nutriscan
A comprehensive mobile nutrition application that lets users scan food barcodes to view detailed nutritional facts, a health score, AI-powered summaries of pros and cons, and healthier alternatives. Built with Flutter, Python, MongoDB, and Gemini API for barcode scanning, health scoring, and dietary recommendations.

### Spotify Random Tracks Player
Spotify Random Tracks Player is a lightweight web application built with Flask that plays random songs from user-specified artists using the Spotify API. Users can enter multiple artist names separated by commas, and the app fetches a random selection of tracks from each artist without creating playlists or queues. Playback is handled directly through Spotify's playback API, keeping the experience simple and instant.

### Falsehoodus Maximus
Falsehoodus Maximus is a playful proof-of-concept chatbot created purely for fun to demonstrate how prompt injection can influence AI behavior. Built using the Google Gemini API, with a FastAPI backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, it intentionally generates wrong, exaggerated, and sometimes controversial answers by design to showcase instruction override vulnerabilities.

## Expertise

### Backend Development
Advanced proficiency in Python and FastAPI for building high-performance backend APIs and web services. Experienced with async programming, Pydantic validation, dependency injection, WebSockets, middleware, and production deployment patterns.

### Frontend & Mobile
Experience with Flutter (Dart) for cross-platform mobile apps, React.js/TypeScript with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS for responsive web interfaces, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and modern UI/UX patterns.

### Web Scraping & Automation
Highly proficient with Selenium + undetected-chromedriver, Playwright headless browsing, BeautifulSoup parsing, anti-bot evasion techniques, and production-grade data collection pipelines.

### Data & Databases
Comfortable working with MongoDB for NoSQL document storage, PostgreSQL/SQL for relational data, Redis for caching, and schema design for scalable applications.

### AI/ML Integration
Experienced in integrating Large Language Models via Google Gemini API to power summaries, chatbots, and AI-augmented interfaces. Familiar with ONNX model deployment and Hugging Face Transformers.
